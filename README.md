# Search App


This application enables a user to comprehensively search data categorized as 'Users', 'Organizations', and 'Tickets'.

### How to use app

Included below is the suggested means by which you can conveniently search the available data if you do not initially know the search term / value pair you want to search:

First, select the 'User Search Terms', 'Organization Search Terms', and/or 'Ticket Search Terms' button(s) to view all available search terms for each of these categories.

Next, copy a search term of interest, select 'Results for Term', enter the term in the appropriate form category, and select 'Search'. A list of values for that search term will appear.

Lastly, select 'Search by Term / Value' if not already selected, and then enter your search term as well as one of the search values from the displayed list in the appropriate form category. This will output all entries within the User, Organization, or Tickets category for that search term / value pair.

An additional method of searching the data includes the following:

If you want to view category entries by tag or domain, first select 'User Tags', 'Organization Tags', 'Ticket Tags', or 'Organization Domains' to view all available tags and domains.

Next, select either 'Results for Tag' or 'Results for Domain', enter the tag or domain of interest in the appropriate form field, and select 'Search'. All entries with that tag or domain within 'Users', 'Organizations', or 'Tickets' will then appear.

### Testing the app

A complete set of form and view tests has been developed.

To run these test scenarios, after installing all package dependencies, open your terminal, change directories to the project root folder, and enter the following command:

python manage.py test
